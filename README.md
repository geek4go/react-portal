# reactboard
An exemple DashBoard application using React / Redux and Mobx

## Installation
* npm install
* npm start

note: you need to install 'reactboardserver' to run the application

## Goal

The goal is to experiment using React/Redux/Mobx in the same application
* Redux manages the flux pattern
* Mobx manages the stores with the observable pattern

It's a strange combination to be able to use mutable data with a complete flux pattern. I'm sure there is a better way to have a flux pattern with Mobx !
